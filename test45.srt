2
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:08,240
A woman vanished last night.

3
00:01:11,183 --> 00:01:12,452
We just found the body.

4
00:01:14,618 --> 00:01:15,414
Prints?

5
00:01:18,226 --> 00:01:19,584
And the head...

6
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:22,546
is missing.

7
00:01:28,184 --> 00:01:30,137
He calls himself The Snowman killer.

8
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,433
He's completely insane.

9
00:01:37,836 --> 00:01:40,772
I'm thinking that he is going off
to women that he disapproves of.

10
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,529
The only thing we know for sure

11
00:01:48,611 --> 00:01:50,323
is that he is playing games with us.

12
00:01:57,413 --> 00:01:59,499
We need a way to lure him out.

13
00:02:03,086 --> 00:02:03,962
Be careful.

14
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:07,132
We don't know
what we are dealing with.

15
00:02:15,073 --> 00:02:16,683
He's been watching us
the whole time.

16
00:02:17,391 --> 00:02:20,330
Building snowmen,
cutting things up into small pieces.

17
00:02:20,455 --> 00:02:21,813
He is taunting us.

18
00:02:22,772 --> 00:02:25,192
If we don't find him,
this is never going to stop.

19
00:02:27,568 --> 00:02:28,403
Come on!

20
00:02:31,364 --> 00:02:32,699
Another missing woman.

21
00:02:32,865 --> 00:02:34,576
There's something we're not seeing.

22
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:38,747
What matters most is that we celebrate
the way this is brought us together.

23
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,876
Anyone can see
that he is trying to hide something.

24
00:02:43,676 --> 00:02:45,253
You can't force the pieces to fit.

25
00:02:45,962 --> 00:02:47,089
<i>You could have saved them.</i>

26
00:02:47,255 --> 00:02:47,964
No.

27
00:02:48,589 --> 00:00:45,050
<i>I gave you all the clues.</i>
